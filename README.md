When chemists synthesize peptides, how do they identify unknown substances in mass spectra caused by the absence of one or more amino acids?
This project can display the sum of all possible combinations of a peptide, which is composed of amino acids
Before showing the function of this calculator, we start to introduce the peptide first

A peptide is composed of amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. These amino acids are linked in a specific sequence, forming a chain that defines the structure and function of the peptide.

A peptide is a string of amino acids. https://www.cellgs.com/blog

Solid phase peptide technique: 
       The **solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS)** technique is widely used for constructing peptides. This technique involves sequentially adding amino acids to a growing chain, anchored to a solid support, allowing for efficient purification and synthesis of complex peptides.
        SPPS is crucial for pharmaceutical manufacturing because it allows for the efficient, scalable, and precise production of peptides, which are increasingly used as therapeutic agents. Key benefits for pharmaceutical companies.

 During the synthesis process, we may lose some amino acids. For example, if I synthesize a sequence "SGDEPA" and a peak appears in the mass spectrum, its sequence is missing two amino acids, G and D. To quickly identify this peak, developing a small program to calculate all possible combinations of amino acid molecular weights will save time in identifying unknown peaks in mass spectra caused by fragment loss.

 Letâ€™s start understanding how this program works?
